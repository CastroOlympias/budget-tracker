This gif demonstrates offline capabilities to save deposit and withdrawal data to the IndexedDB database, while demonstrating connectivity to the Atlas MongoDB that is setup for the Heroku app.

This gif demonstrates PWA functionality, where both the PWA app and web browser both communicate to the same Atlas MongoDB, as demonstrated by refreshing the PWA app and webpage showing a deposit from the webpage as test 4 and a withdrawal from the PWA app as test 5. Both are able to synchronize from the same database.
